# FantasyFootball_Analyzer

Context & Content:
This dataset features the statistics of 192 NFL players from the 2019 season. The original raw CSV file was acquired from https://apps.dynastyprocess.com/calculator/,
and through web scraping I added additional predictor columns. The response variable for this analysis is the "Value" column which comes from a popular Dynasty fantasy football calculator https://apps.dynastyprocess.com/calculator/ . I want to figure out what are the biggest factors influencing the "Value" on this particular list.
